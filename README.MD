BlockChainTx is a fun project I started to improve my understanding of web UIs, blockchain technology, database management, developing CLI apps, and hosting a (node.js?) website.

It will either become a tax calculator, market trading bot, rss feed aggregator, or dapp.

  urllib & json lib for http requests

  pycli: command line interface for BlockChainTx
    setup.py: run to install pycli
    related files: pycli/, install.sh, setup.py
    once installed it will create a pycli.egg-info file in the main folder.


MongoDB init cmd:
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="C:\Users\alexa\Desktop\BlockChainTx\Database"
