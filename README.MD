BlockChainTx is a fun project I started to improve my understanding of web UIs, blockchain technology, database management, developing CLI apps, and hosting a (node.js?) website.

It will either become a tax calculator, market trading bot, rss feed aggregator, or dapp.

  urllib & json lib for http requests
  mongodb through pymongo


  BlockChainTx: command line interface for BlockChainTx
    setup.py: run to install pycli
    related files: BlockChainTx/, install.sh, setup.py
    once installed it will create a BlockChainTx.egg-info file in the main folder.

  Comments incomplete & most of the code is very messy. Working towards cleaner & more efficient codebase.
